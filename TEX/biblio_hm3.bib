@article{Corbella2004,
	Abstract = {A large number of Mississippi Valley-Type (MVT) deposits are located within dissolution zones in carbonate host rocks. Some genetic models propose the existence of cavities generated by an earlier event such as a shallow karstification, that were subsequently filled with hydrothermal minerals. Alternative models propose carbonate dissolution caused by the simultaneous precipitation of sulfides. These models fail to explain either the deep geological setting of the cavities, or the observational features which suggest that the dissolution of carbonates and the precipitation of minerals filling the cavities are not strictly coeval. We present a genetic model inspired by the textural characteristics of MVT deposits that accounts for both the dissolution of carbonate and precipitation of sulfides and later carbonates in variable volumes. The model is based on the mixing of two hydrothermal fluids with a different chemistry. Depending on the proportion of the end members, the mixture dissolves and precipitates carbonates even though the two mixing solutions are both independently saturated in carbonates. We perform reactive transport simulations of mixing of a regional groundwater and brine ascending through a fracture, both saturated in calcite, but with different overall chemistries (Ca and carbonate concentrations, pH, etc). As a result of the intrinsic effects of chemical mixing, a carbonate dissolution zone, which is enhanced by acid brines, appears above the fracture, and another zone of calcite precipitation builds up between the cavity and the surrounding rock. Sulfide forms near the fracture and occupies a volume smaller than the cavity. A decline of the fluid flux in the fracture would cause the precipitation of calcite within the previously formed cavities. Therefore, dissolution of carbonate host rock, sulfide precipitation within the forming cavity, and later filling by carbonates may be part of the same overall process of mixing of fluids in the carbonate host rock.},

@article{Sibley87,
	Abstract = {Dolomite rock textures can be classified according to crystal size distribution and crystal boundary shape. The classification scheme presented here is largely descriptive but carries genetic implications because size distribution is controlled by both nucleation and growth kinetics, and crystal boundary shape is controlled by growth kinetics. Size distributions are classified as unimodal or polymodal. Crystal boundary shapes are classified as planar or nonplanar. If the evidence permits, a complete classification includes a description of recognizable allochems, matrix, and void filling. Allochems and preexisting cements may be unreplaced, partially replaced, replaced mimically, or replaced nonmimically. Allochems may be dissolved, leaving molds. Matrix can be unreplace, partially replaced, or replaced by a unimodal or polymodal size dolomite. Unimodal size distributions generally indicated a single nucleation event on a unimodal substrate. Polymodal sizes can be formed by multiple nucleation events on a unimodal or polymodal substrate or differential nucleation on an originally polymodal substrate. Planar crystal boundaries develop when crystals undergo faceted growth, and nonplanar boundaries develop when crystals undergo nonfaceted growth. Nonplanar boundaries are characteristic of growth at elevated temperature (\&gt; 50 degrees C) and/or high supersaturation. Both planar and nonplanar dolomite can form as a cement, replacement of CaCO 3 , or neomorphism of a precursor dolomite.},

	\lettrine{W}{e} left Primadona after focussing on the shallow leads ICCC had started to explore in 2016. While our main efforts concentrated on three pushing fronts (DÃ©ja Vu, Electric Dreams and Fenestrator), short reconnaissance trips and resurvey projects raised the possibility of a new underground camp closer to the old Slovenian pushing front, at -600m. On a particular exchange trip between the TTT and Karstaway branches, three possible sites were spotted; it will be the goal of the forthcoming year to determine which is most suitable for the objective of 'bottoming' the cave at last. 

	To throw spanners in the works, the eleventh-hour extension of Hallelujah streamway to Sweet Baby Jesus, an the pitch series of Alabaster contributed to shifting the aims and expectations of future expeditions. It now seems certain that at least part of the motivation for exploring Primadona will be down to the awaiting, half-descended pitch, hovering above blank mountain. Time will tell whether it will prove key to unlocking yet another of the Hollow Mountain's secrets.

\chapter{2015 - Pivo Moz}
		\lettrine{W}{ith} 2.2 km discovered in Vrtnarija, all below 600 m, Pivo Moz 2015 was another successful year of deep pushing. Significant work went into the extensions off Sic Semper Tyrannis which led to the closure of an 840m loop in the south, while Colarado Duck was passed with a further 270m of passage found beyond. Aven climbing at Strap on the Nitro enabled the discovery of 294 m of south trending passage heading towards Wonderstuff in the ‘old system’. 

		For the first time in Migovec exploration two underground camps were operational at the same time: Camp X-Ray at -650 m, a 4 berth camp set up in a central position, and Camp Deep Core II at -850 m near Red Cow, a 2 berth camp set up by divers Jarvist Frost and Connor Roe for future use as access to the Watership Down sump, and used this year by them as a staging post for the northern extensions. Camp X-Ray remained the main exploration camp. All leads however were then more than 2.5 hours away, raising the possibility of setting up another camp, closer to the southern leads in Sic Semper Tyrannis.

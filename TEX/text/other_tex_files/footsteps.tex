\part{Excursions under the mountain: in the footsteps of the explorers}
	\lettrine{W}{ith} over 39km of explored passage, Sistem Migovec is the longest cave system in Slovenia, and ranks among the 50 longest worldwide. The description of every metre of this cave is impossible as countless recesses, cracks, indomitable crawls or squeezes saw the light of one or two cavers, who, running low on energy and motivation, decided that 'that was it'. Such passages may not be visited again in years, or indeed ever, as focus shifts towards other 'leads', and will remain intact, but for the single track of footprints that bears witness to the presence of one explorer. Such passages may endure within memory as traces on a larger map or a name in a directory. Others will become highways, passed by many explorers en route to the business end of the cave: pitches, galleries, streamways, they bear the mark of our presence: footprints, dislodged boulders, ropes. We hope to describe such routes which through their connections and their loops form the growing skeleton of the system. The itineraries reported in this section range from short half-day trips  to longer excursions and through-trips and finally, navigation to the pushing fronts from the underground camps.

\@writefile{lof}{\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {121}{\ignorespaces Because the Slovene army pilots having a flight quota to complete each year, helicopters have often heli-lifted gear and provisions to the Sheperds Hut, and even as far as the sunset spot on top of the mountain. During the rescue, however, the pilots flew directly to the cave entrance of Primadona, hovering a few metres from the cliff edge, in the black of night, playing no small part in facilitating the rescue effort. Praise must also go the 60 strong team of cavers and mountaineers drawn from across Slovenia who participated in all aspects of the rescue: from communications, cooking, blasting and bolting teams to the medics who took charge and to the JSPDT members who knew the cave and acted as guides --- photo by Jana \v {C}arga}}{207}{figure.caption.260}}

\paragraph{$7^{th}$ August 2013: } Yesterday we went to check the draughting holes in Vrtnarija valley that Dave was talking about. We followed the path that Janet and Antonio made. There are three interesting spots we found.

The first one is a vertical fault line, it opens up to a pitch that you wouldn't need a rope to go in. It is about 70cm wide and about 6m high, and then probably drops probably ~20m. There is no draught that I could spot.
This one is \emph{S5}. Coordinates:

\begin{itemize}
	\item N 46.25254 , E 13.77087,Altitude: 1627m
\end{itemize}


Continuing along the path, ~150m before reaching the upper Razor-Kal path, on the right side, ~6m from the path, a strongly draughting boulder choke is found. The draught is about the same as S1; it does need work but it is quite promising! The best looking lead in the area.
This one is \emph{S6}. Coordinates:

\begin{itemize}
	\item N 46.25053, E 13.77094, Altitude: 1570m
\end{itemize}

Further along the path, just ~50m from S6, cold air is draughting from between the boulders. This is not really an entrance but it may be dug into something. This one is \emph{S7}. Coordinates:

\begin{itemize}
	\item N 46.25037, E 13.77139,  Altitude: 1560m
\end{itemize}

The area may be interesting for looking for further leads; there is definitely a good amount of air coming out.

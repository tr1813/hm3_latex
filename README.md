# hm3_latex 

This project compiles exploration stories and notes from ICCC and JSPDT members overthey years 2013-2017.


### Architecture

Each year \chapter{} has a separate, dedicated folder ( e.g. 2013).

Each \section{} has a separate, nested folder too, containing the images used within. \subsections do not.

The master file is Hollowmountain3.tex, and has all the \include commands.
